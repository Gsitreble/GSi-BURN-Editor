# GSi-BURN-Editor
Source code of the GSi BURN Editor software for Win/Mac

This is the entire source code of the GSi BURN Editor software for Windows and OSX. The GSi BURN is (was) a digital multi-effect for keyboards and guitars, mainly focused at the Rotary Speaker simulation. It is now discontinued, so there isn't much to do with this editor program any more, but I'd like to share it with the community because there are a few interesting aspects that may have some educational importance. First, it communicates with the BURN via MIDI, and uses RtMidi to open MIDI ports and exchange SysEx data. Second, the GUI is based on wxWidgets version 2.8 (32 bit only on Mac).

Requires:
- RtMidi
- wxWidgets 2.8
